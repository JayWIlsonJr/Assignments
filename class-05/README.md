The assignment is to use all the features of Sass to clean up your Surf & Paddle CSS.

- NO IDS in CSS
- You should use the gulp file and package.json from the class notes for Sass compilation.
- You must follow the style guide [found here](https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css).
- You should use nesting when appropriate, but should follow the rules of the style guide to avoid deep nesting.
- *All* of your colors and fixed values (e.g. pixel or em sizes) should be moved to well named variables.
- Any reusable rules should be moved to well named mixins.

## Level Up

If this isn't enough for you, read through the Bourbon docs and see if you can't use some of the cool mixins to make your stuff even more awesome.
