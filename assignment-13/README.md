Using the [client requirements](SwampRabbitRequirements.md), you will need to:

- Come up with stories and tasks
- Figure out who will work on which stories
- Create a new project and have everyone use the forking and pull request flow (see class notes for more info)

The project is due Monday. Today, you should focus on project planning and creating a test repository to practice the git and GitHub concepts. If you finish that, you can start working on the actual project code.

You will need to just pick a location on the Swamp Rabbit Trail, since this is a fake business.
