# Company Background
Swamp Rabbit Cycling is the premier cycling shop for the Greater Greenville area! We’ve been serving the area for over 25 years and are the number one source for all things bikes. We carry everything from mountain bike equipment to bike related clothing and safety gear. WE are a family owned private business and take pride in our long standing tradition of providing the best service in the area.

# Scope and Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create an online presence to help promote our unique family owned business. We understand the need for an online presence to serve as a way for our customers to connect with us.

We also understand the need to keep up with current design trends to help market our business. We’ve currently been using the attached clipart to serve as our logo and realize how updating our look will help us grow.

# Single Page Website
While we do have plans to expand our website, we’re currently needing something up and running as soon as possible. Here are some of the items we’ll need by next week (also included in the wireframe):

- New logo for Swamp Rabbit Cycling
- Single page where users are able to get our address + contact information
- Use the Flickr API to pull in the most recent and interesting public bike images.
- Google Map of where we are located in Greenville

Being in a mobile driven age, we understand the importance of being mobile friendly. We’ve created a second wireframe to display the mobile view of a website. The image gallery should change into a swipe-able interface.
