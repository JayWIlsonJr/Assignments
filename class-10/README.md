The assignment is to recreate the repository tab on your GitHub profile (e.g. https://github.com/jacobthemyth?tab=repositories).

## Data
Switch out your own username for the following URLs:
- https://api.github.com/users/jacobthemyth
- https://api.github.com/users/jacobthemyth/repos
- https://api.github.com/users/jacobthemyth/starred

There is a considerable amount of data, so you'll probably want to store it in a separate file.

# Bonus

Recreate the Public activity and/or Contributions tabs.
