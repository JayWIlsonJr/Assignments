Finish working on your todo list. Add the ability to sync with http://tiny-pizza-server.herokuapp.com/.

## Optional
Make a full fledged productivity app.
- Add projects, which consist of todos. Like a todo, a project can be completed.
- Add scheduled todos, which have their own list, but appear in the main list on their scheduled date.
- Check out [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) for ideas.


## And/or

Try to write a todo app in Backbone from scratch, without looking at other code.
