As a group, you will be building a turn based battle game. If you're familiar with older video games, think of Pokemon or Final Fantasy. The UI can be very very basic, just some headings for names and info, a dropdown, and a couple of buttons.
- You will need to turn in your Trello board with all of your stories. (You should write as many stories as possible before programming so that tasks can be more easily delegated amongst the team).
- The gameplay should go back and forth between an enemy and the player, each inflicting damage on the other when they launch a successful attack.
- There should be multiple player types.
- There should be multiple enemy types.
- You should be able to select the player type from a dropdown.
- The enemy type should be randomly generated.
- The player should manually select the "Fight" action to attack.
- The enemy should automatically attack when it is its turn.
- You should use constructors and prototypes for the players and enemies.
- The player's health should be visible.
- The enemies health may be visible, at your discretion.
- Your constructors and prototype methods for players and enemies should be tested.

## Optional
- The player should be able to either "Fight" or "Use Magic", or some similar setup. Each player type should have different types of attack and/or magic.
- Give the player the ability to use items, such as items that regain health or increase attack.
- Make a party of players, rather than just one (a la Final Fantasy). The game play would cycle between Player 1 -> Enemy -> Player 2 -> Enemy, etc.
- Implement "ailments". E.g. being poisoned makes you weaker, being put to sleep makes you skip your turn.

## Power Level 9000
Use http://tiny-pizza-server.herokuapp.com/ to make the game multiplayer. You could either have multiple players, or have one person control the enemy and one control the player.

# Pro Tips
- Feel free to use separate JavaScript files to avoid merge conflicts.

# Resources
- If you have no idea what any of this means, read through [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gameplay_of_Final_Fantasy#Parties_and_battles) and/or [watch this](http://youtube.com/watch?v=MNmKNhm-1Js).
- Artwork is not required, but if you'd like to include artwork, [this might help](http://opengameart.org). Maybe [this too](http://open.commonly.cc). Get your game working before you introduce artwork. If you have a beautiful page that doesn't work, it will be considered an incomplete assignment.
