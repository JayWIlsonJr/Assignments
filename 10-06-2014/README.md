1. Watch [Simple Made Easy](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy). The first half is the most important, so if you start feeling lost when he starts talking about Lisp and parentheses, feel free to stop. It's worth the effort if you can wade through the second half, though.
2. Achieve greater familiarity with Backbone syntax and structure by completing these exercises. Each exercise should have its own html and js file, named after the exercise. For example, exercise a should have an `a.html` and a `a.js`.
    - a) Create a form that saves a blog post to http://tiny-pizza-server.herokuapp.com/collections/posts. The post should have a title and a body. It does not need to display blog posts, just save them.
    - b) Create a form for a person. It should have a first name, last name, address, and phone number. The form should validate the correct formats on submit. It should save the person to http://tiny-pizza-server.herokuapp.com/collections/people
    - c) Create a "blog reading app", where you have a list of blog posts on the side and when you click on a post title, it opens that post in another view. You can use the data at http://tiny-pizza-server.herokuapp.com/collections/posts. Hint: which blog post is selected is "application state".
    - d) Create a bookmarking app where you can save URLs. It should have a form where you enter the URL, a title, and a "tag". There should be a list of all the URLs, as well as a list of all the tags (this should be generated dynamically from the link collection). When you click on a tag, the link list should show only those tags. Hint: which tag is selected is "application state".
    - e) Create a todo app from scratch. Try not to look at any tutorials or other code.

3. When you're finished with the above exercises, work on improving the Backbone guide at https://github.com/TIY-GVL-FEE-2014-Aug/backbone-adventure.
