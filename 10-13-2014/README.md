A local baker has approached you with an application idea. See the wireframe images in the current directory and complete the application using Ember. Due Friday.

# Proposal
## State the Scene
A local baker needs to be able to scale recipes up and down depending on the yield or the availability of a certain ingredient. They currently use an extremely complex Excel doc.

## Who’s Affected
Bakers. Bakers would use excel or calculators to manually adjust their recipes based on the needs of that day or available ingredients. This is time consuming, tedious, and has a high risk of error.

## What’s the Challenge

- The app needs to be viewable and usable on all platforms.
- They need to create an account, enter and save their recipes, and share the recipes with others.
- As best as possible, prevent someone from stealing the recipe.
- When a recipe is created, a baker should be able to specify the type of measurement (grams or cups) of the recipe.
- There needs to be an option to change the unit of measurement per ingredient (ounces or pounds).
- And there needs to be the option to change the type of measurement by weight (imperial or metric).
- There needs to be the ability to specify the yield number and yield name (scones, loaves, cookies, etc).
- Bakers should be able to enter in their own ingredients and the brand or type of that ingredient. Bakers should also enter in the price of that ingredient (not MVP) to calculate overall cost.
- There needs to be a “notes” section to allow bakers to enter in notes about the recipe (bake time, instructions, etc).

## What’s the Opportunity
Gives bakers the ability to accurately adjust and view recipes quickly without a lot of thought or error.
