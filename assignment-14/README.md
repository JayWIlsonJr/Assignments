1. Change all of the URLs to work with GitHub Pages
  - Absolute URLs should start with `//`, not `http://`
  - You should use relative URLs rather than absolute URLs for your local assets (i.e. `images/header.png`, not `/images/header.png`).
2. Deploy ALL your assignments to GitHub Pages.
3. Create a portfolio repository and start working on what you might want that to look like.
  - It should probably use tiy-webapp so you can use SCSS, etc.
  - It should probably use Neat or another grid framework.
  - It should *definitely* be responsive (I would design it mobile-first).

We will work on curating your portfolio later, right now it should link to all of your work. You most likely won't have all of your work listed when you start applying to jobs, but I want to make sure we're all comfortable with GitHub Pages.
