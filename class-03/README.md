1. Read http://alistapart.com/article/flat-ui-and-forms
2. Create HTML and CSS files for a small, styled form and a sidebar. An example would be https://github.com/settings/profile, but just the form and the sidebar, not necessarily the header or anything.
  - It should use border, border-radius, appearance, and outline properties to make it look different from a native form.
  - It should use a gradient on the button (again, see the GitHub profile for an example).
  - It should use the inline block layout to position the form next to the sidebar (http://learnlayout.com/inline-block-layout.html).
  - It should use the section and nav elements for the form and sidebar, respectively.
  - It should be submitted via GitHub.
