Create an Etsy listing page using data from the API. For example, if you wanted to create a listing page about board games, use the URL https://api.etsy.com/v2/listings/active?api_key=cdwxq4soa7q4zuavbtynj8wx&keywords=board%20games&includes=Images,Shop to get the data and use jQuery and CSS to create a pages that looks like the [Etsy listing page for board games](https://www.etsy.com/search?q=board%20games), not including the header, footer, sidebar, etc.

You are free to change the search term to whatever you'd like.

We haven't covered how to fetch data using JavaScript, so just copy the data and store it in a variable.

## Bonus
- Implement the sorting dropdown.
- Pull the categories from the data to create the sidebar, with links that filter the listings.
- Register for your own [Etsy developer account](https://www.etsy.com/developers/register) and use your own API key.
- Play around with adding more advanced hover effects to the images, like [these](http://tympanus.net/Development/HoverEffectIdeas/).
