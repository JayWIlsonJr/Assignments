# 09/16/14

Build a web app that allows you to view your open GitHub issues.
- You will need to create a GitHub token. (follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/TIY-GVL-FEE-2014-Aug/Notes/tree/master/class-11#github-api-access), but also add the `repo` scope).
- It should use yeoman and underscore templates
- It should show a list of your open issues, title only.
- Each title should be a link that shows the issue with its comments in a separate container.
- The issues and comments for an issue should update in "real time".

# If you finish the above.

Add the ability to comment on and close an issue.
