1. Watch the [EmberConf keynote](http://www.confreaks.com/videos/3297-emberconf2014-keynote) to learn about some of the philosophies behind Ember.js. The first 5 minutes are about conference logistics, but the rest of the video is very relevant to us.
2. Read the "Concepts", "The Object Model", and "Application" sections of the [Ember Guides](http://emberjs.com/guides/).
3. If you feel like you'd like an overview of the concepts of Ember in a more visual way, there's a great screencast on the landing page of the [Ember Guides](http://emberjs.com/guides/).
4. Try to finish the "Getting Started" tutorial.
